						<h3>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe
							it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under

							<strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.,
							express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in
							situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can
							withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent .
						</p>
						<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to</p>
						<p>process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be
								obtained in a timely way

						</ul>
						<ul>

								purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the
								laws of Canada or a province
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>
								If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules
								of the court relating to the production of records
							</li>

								If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or
								profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the

							advertising about products and services tailored to your interests that may appear
							either on our Services or on other websites.
						</p>
						<p>
							To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a

							Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party

							provider concerned, but often include your name, email address, friends list, and
							profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a
							social media platform.
						</p>

							in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
							period of time in which users have an account with us.
						</p>
						<p>
							When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
							we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for
							example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then
							we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
							processing until deletion is possible.
						</p>
						<hr />
						<h3>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>

							<strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a
							system of organizational and technical security measures.
						</p>
						<p>
							We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security
							measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
							However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
							transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
							be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
							other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
							improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our
							best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
							from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
							secure environment.

							<strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept

						<h3>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
						<p>
							Most Web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
							Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your
							privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
							and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
							implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
							DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
							not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
							follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
							this privacy notice.
						</p>
						<p>
							California law requires us to let you know how we respond to browser DNT signals.
							Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or
							honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
